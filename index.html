        <h1>My Online CV</h1>
        <p>I am a data administrator for Nedbank. 
            I work under the retail business banking cluster, and we assist with credit card related queries. 
            A very good working environment where we can all share ideas and implement them according to the businesses standards. 
            My experience in the banking industry has been nothing short of amazing.  

            I am currently studying Software Engineering at HyperionDev. 
            One of my passions is to learn more about developing applications and games.
            Learning about technology as a whole is a critical part of the modern life, shaping how we work, communicate, and solve problems. 
            
            Learning and knowing more about life and the world we live in is enough motivation for me to get out of bed every morning. 
            I look forward to each and everyday because everyday is a gift, very spontaneous and unpredictable. Being aware of that makes life worth living. 
            I am willing to learn new skills to advance my career in a position that allows me to grow as a person as well as an employee.
